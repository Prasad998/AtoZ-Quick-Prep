# 🧠 Binary Search ( Question Pattern Identification)
Binary Search is more than searching in sorted arrays. Many problems involve searching over *answers*, *positions*, or even *conditions*.

## ✅ When to Use Binary Search
- Array or result space is **sorted** or has **monotonic behavior**.
- You are told to:
  - "Find the first/last occurrence"
  - "Minimize/Maximize something"
  - "Find an index/value under constraints"
- Linear approach is too slow → Think `O(log N)`.

## 🧩 Common Patterns

| Pattern                            | Use Case Example                                                  |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classic Binary Search**          | Search for a value in a sorted array                             |
| **First/Last Occurrence**          | Boundaries, range counts                                         |
| **Search on Answer (Parametric)**  | Find smallest/largest valid answer (min/max speed, time, etc.)   |
| **Rotated Sorted Array**           | Pivoted sorted arrays                                            |
| **2D Binary Search**               | Search inside a matrix                                           |
| **Peak Element / Inflection**      | Local maxima/minima in array                                     |

## 💡 Tips
- Binary Search works when the **search space is monotonic**.
- Use `low + (high - low) / 2` to avoid overflow.
- Modify conditions to suit problem:
  - Search on index? → Binary search on `array`
  - Search on answer? → Binary search on `value range`
- Consider variants like:
  - Lower Bound (first true condition)
  - Upper Bound (last true condition)
