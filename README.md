**Learning Path**

**Challenge yourself**
Getting good at DSA is similar to building muscles in the gym.

**Lifting the same weights everyday won't make you stronger. You need to slowly lift heavier weights to build muscle.**

Likewise, to get better at DSA, you should slowly tackle harder problems.

Example: If you can comfortably solve most easy problems, move to medium problems.

**Understand, donâ€™t memorize**
When learning DSA, focus on understanding the underlying concepts and principles rather than just memorizing code or solutions.

**Memorization may help you solve specific problems, but it limits your ability to adapt and apply your knowledge to new scenarios.**

**
Repetition is key to transferring knowledge from short-term to long-term memory.
By revisiting concepts and problems regularly, you reinforce your understanding and make it easier to recall the information later.
